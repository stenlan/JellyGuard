# JellyGuard
Plugin aimed at hardening JellyFin, among other improvements

Very very early rushed code at the moment.

* Custom authentication providers
* Hijacks DB migrations
* Supports TOTP (only backend, no frontend support yet)
* Extra safety from third parties accidentally using an old/invalid auth provider
* Other cool dark magic
